## 📌 Project Overview

**SmartScan AI** is a comprehensive and intelligent **Document Analysis Pipeline** designed to automate the transformation of real-world physical documents into structured, high-quality digital data.

In real-world scenarios, documents captured using mobile cameras often suffer from:
- Perspective distortion (tilted or angled images)
- Uneven lighting conditions (shadows, glare)
- Background noise and blur
- Loss of clarity in text regions

To solve these issues, SmartScan AI integrates both:
- **Classical Computer Vision techniques** (for geometric corrections and enhancement)
- **Modern Deep Learning approaches** (for verification and intelligent understanding)

Unlike traditional scanning systems, this project goes beyond simple digitization by introducing a **Hybrid AI Layer** that ensures both **visual quality** and **data accuracy**.

## 🧠 Hybrid AI Architecture

The system is designed as a multi-layer intelligent pipeline:

### 🔹 1. Computer Vision Pipeline
- Detects document boundaries
- Corrects perspective distortion
- Enhances image quality
- Prepares image for OCR

### 🔹 2. CNN Verification Layer
- Deep learning model verifies extracted numerical values
- Ensures correctness of critical fields like totals, amounts, IDs

### 🔹 3. OCR Engine (Tesseract)
- Extracts machine-readable text from processed images
- Converts visual content into structured text

### 🔹 4. Real-Time Processing Layer
- Uses webcam input for live document scanning
- Provides instant feedback and analysis

👉 This layered design ensures robustness, scalability, and real-world usability.

## 🤖 AI Concept Mapping

SmartScan AI is inspired by intelligent systems such as **Face Recognition Attendance Systems**, where visual input is processed and converted into meaningful structured data.

| Feature | AI Attendance System | SmartScan AI Equivalent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Detection** | Face Detection (Haar/SSD) | Document Contour Detection |
| **Rectification** | Face Alignment | 4-Point Perspective Warp |
| **Verification** | Feature Encoding (CNN) | Digit Verification (CNN) |
| **Extraction** | Identity Recognition | OCR Text Extraction |
| **Output** | Attendance CSV | Structured JSON/Text Data |

👉 This mapping highlights how VisionScan follows the same **AI perception pipeline logic**.

## 📑 Detailed Module Breakdown

### 🔹 Module 1: Initial Setup & Warping

- Detects document contour using edge detection + contour analysis
- Sorts 4 corner points (top-left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left)
- Uses **Perspective Transformation Matrix**

Key function:
- `cv2.getPerspectiveTransform`
- `cv2.warpPerspective`

👉 Converts distorted quadrilateral into a rectangular image.

### 🔹 Module 2: Noise Reduction & Edge Logic

- **Bilateral Filtering**
  - Removes noise while preserving edges
- **Morphological Closing**
  - Fills gaps in document boundaries
  - Ensures continuous contours

👉 Improves accuracy of edge detection and contour extraction.

---

### 🔹 Module 3: Segmentation & Adaptive Thresholding

- Uses **Canny Edge Detection** for boundary extraction
- Applies **Adaptive Thresholding (Gaussian)**:
  - Handles uneven lighting
  - Enhances text clarity

👉 Produces OCR-ready high-contrast image.

---

### 🔹 Module 4: CNN Character Verification

A lightweight **Convolutional Neural Network** is used to validate extracted digits.

Architecture:
- **Conv2D Layers** → Feature extraction
- **MaxPooling** → Dimensionality reduction
